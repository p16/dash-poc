Act as an analyst to produce a competitive analysis of UK SIM-only plans comparing two specific brands.
Include analysis on identifying competitive advantages and strategic opportunities.
The entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Remember to always use double quotes for properties names, and the : between property name and value.
Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown outside of the JSON block itself.
Consider the plans provided for {{BRAND_A}} and {{BRAND_B}} in the files attached to this prompt.
The file name will tell you from which competitor they belong to. The only different one is the one from uswitch that will contain different plans from different companies.
For your analysis, consider ALL plans from {{BRAND_A}} and {{BRAND_B}} in the files attached to this request.


Time & Locale Constraints: Assume current date/time in Europe/London timezone. Currency is GBP (£).

Scope & Data Collection Rules (Simulated Browsing/Lookup):
CRITICAL: You MUST analyze plans across ALL available contract terms (1 month, 12 months, and 24 months). Do not focus only on a single contract length.
For each data tier (Low/Medium/Unlimited), ensure you include comparable plans from DIFFERENT contract terms (1-month, 12-month, and 24-month) in your analysis.
Capture: Brand, Contract, Data (GB/Unlimited), Roaming (None/EU/Global), Price (£/mo), Extras (concise, comma-separated), Source URL, and Notes.

Scoring Model (0–100): Calculate the Competitiveness Score for every plan using the following weighted sum:
- Data Allowance: 40% (Unlimited=100; otherwise linear scale by GB).
- Roaming: 15% (None=0, EU=50, Global=100).
- Extras: 15% (None=0, Basic=50, Premium=100).
- Contract Flexibility: 10% (30-day=100, 12-month=50, 24-month=0; interpolate other terms).
- Price: 20% (Lower price is better; based on range MaxPrice – MinPrice).

IMPORTANT: All competitiveness_score values MUST be numbers between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

Strategy Layer: Analyze {{BRAND_A}}'s position versus {{BRAND_B}} across data tiers (Low: ≤20 GB; Medium: 21–100 GB; Unlimited: >100 GB/Unlimited). Identify gaps, recommend strategic actions, and appropriate pricing.

JSON Output Mandate (STRICT FORMAT):
The JSON object must contain the following top-level fields:
- analysis_timestamp: (String: Current Date/Time in Europe/London timezone).
- currency: (String: 'GBP').
- overall_competitive_sentiments: (Array of Objects: 5 to 10 high-level insights, 3 fields: score, sentiment, rationale; do not change the fields names; focus on how {{BRAND_A}} compares to {{BRAND_B}}; put a higher score on significant competitive differences; avoid single word for the "sentiment" field, be specific; the "rationale" field should contain the description and strategic implications).
- brand_a_products_analysis: (REQUIRED: Analyze at least 5 {{BRAND_A}} products, Array of Objects: Details and competitive context for {{BRAND_A}} plans analyzed; group plans based on the data (GB) tier, suggest product price adjustments).
- full_competitive_dataset_all_plans: (Array of Objects: The complete, flat dataset of ALL plans from both brands considered in the analysis).
- products_not_considered: if you decide to not consider some plans, provide a justification in this field (Array of objects, fields for each object are: product and details; product will contain the company name and the name of the plan not considered; details will contain why it was not considered as part of the analysis)

Nested Structure Requirements:
- Each object within brand_a_products_analysis must contain: product_name, data_tier, roaming_tier, an object named product_breakdown (containing all {{BRAND_A}} plan data and score), an array of objects named comparable_products (listing direct {{BRAND_B}} rivals with all plan data across MULTIPLE contract terms - include 1-month, 12-month, and 24-month options where available; fields to use: brand, contract, data, roaming, price_per_month_GBP, extras, speed, notes, competitiveness_score, source_URL, source (the name of the file from which it came from, examples: o2, smarty, vodafone, three, giffgaff, sky, tesco, uswitch); do not change their names), and an array of strings named brand_a_product_sentiments (containing specific {{BRAND_A}} strategy notes), brand_a_product_changes (what should {{BRAND_A}} change to be more competitive, array of strings, take into consideration price changes, extras or data allowance), price_suggestions (array of objects containing suggestions on how {{BRAND_A}} should change their prices to beat or better compete with {{BRAND_B}}; fields for each object are: motivation, price), source (the name of the file from which it came from, examples: o2, smarty, vodafone, three, giffgaff, sky, tesco, uswitch).
- Each object within full_competitive_dataset_all_plans must be flat and contain: brand, contract, data, roaming, price_per_month_GBP (Number), extras, speed, notes, competitiveness_score (Number), source_URL, source (the name of the file from which it came from, examples: o2, smarty, vodafone, three, giffgaff, sky, tesco, uswitch).
- When you are setting the "Brand" in any of the above objects, if the source is "uswitch" then the brand should be "<brand> uswitch" (examples: "o2 uswitch", "vodafone uswitch", "three uswitch", etc.)

Source File Naming Convention:
Plans will come from these source files: o2.json, smarty.json, vodafone.json, three.json, giffgaff.json, sky.json, tesco.json, uswitch.json
The "source" field in your JSON output should match the filename without the .json extension (e.g., "o2", "smarty", "uswitch").

PLACEHOLDER INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
When using this prompt template, replace the following placeholders with actual brand names:
- {{BRAND_A}}: The primary brand being analyzed (e.g., "O2", "Vodafone", "Sky")
- {{BRAND_B}}: The comparison brand (e.g., "Vodafone", "Three", "Smarty")

Example: To compare Vodafone vs Three, replace {{BRAND_A}} with "Vodafone" and {{BRAND_B}} with "Three".
