gate: PASS
status_reason: 'All acceptance criteria met with excellent implementation quality. Event persistence architecture, centralized hook pattern, and pragmatic MVP decisions demonstrate strong engineering. No blocking issues.'

# Detailed Assessment
requirements_traceability: COMPLETE
test_coverage: ADEQUATE
  - manual_testing: verified
  - automated_testing: deferred (infrastructure story)
  - recommendation: add tests when dashboard components refactored

code_quality: EXCELLENT
  - architecture: event persistence superior to ephemeral state
  - patterns: useInngestJob eliminates 60+ lines duplication
  - error_handling: graceful dev/prod mode degradation
  - documentation: comprehensive inline and generated docs

security: NO_CONCERNS
  - credentials: properly protected in .env.local
  - sql_injection: parameterized queries
  - data_exposure: event IDs not sensitive

performance: OPTIMIZED
  - database_indexes: event_id, created_at, event_name
  - pagination: ready (100 events)
  - deduplication: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING

technical_debt: NONE

# Recommendations
next_steps:
  - Deploy to production with Inngest Cloud integration
  - Run test-inngest-api script to document production API format
  - Use findings to implement progress tracking UI (future story)
  - Add automated tests when refactoring dashboard components

# Risk Profile
risk_level: LOW
risk_factors:
  - Production API format unknown (mitigated by test script)
  - No automated tests (acceptable for infrastructure story)

confidence_level: HIGH
