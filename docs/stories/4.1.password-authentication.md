# Story 4.1: Simple Password Authentication

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a password-protected login screen,
**so that** only authorized users can access the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Login page created with password input field
2. Password validated against `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` environment variable
3. Successful login creates session (cookie or JWT)
