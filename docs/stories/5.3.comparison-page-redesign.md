# Story 5.3: Redesign Custom Comparison Page

## Epic
Epic 5: UI Redesign with shadcn/ui Design System

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

As a pricing analyst,
I want a redesigned comparison page with side-by-side layout and easy access to recent analyses,
So that I can quickly compare brands without losing sight of my comparison history.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Comparison page at `src/app/dashboard/comparison/page.tsx`
- Technology: Next.js 16 App Router, Client Component for interactivity, shadcn/ui Select component
- Follows pattern: Client-side state management, API calls to /api/analyze, split-panel layout
- Touch points: POST /api/analyze endpoint, analyses database table, Inngest background jobs

**Design Reference:**
- Wireframe: `docs/front-end-spec.md` - Screen 2: Custom Comparison Page & Screen 5: Dedicated Analysis Page
- Implementation guide: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Section 6 (Comparison Page)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Split-Panel Layout**
   - [ ] Left panel: 30% width on desktop, sticky positioning (lg:sticky lg:top-20)
   - [ ] Right panel: 70% width on desktop, scrollable independently
   - [ ] Single column on tablet (768px-1023px), left panel above right panel
   - [ ] Grid: `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3`, left panel `lg:col-span-1`, right panel `lg:col-span-2`

2. **Brand Selector Component**
   - [ ] Two Select dropdowns: Brand A and Brand B
   - [ ] Dropdown options: O2, Vodafone, Three, EE, Sky, Tesco, Smarty, Giffgaff
   - [ ] Brand B options disable the selected Brand A
   - [ ] "Compare Brands" button disabled if brands not valid (empty or same brand)
   - [ ] Visual separator between dropdowns (↕ character, text-2xl)
   - [ ] Labels: "Brand A" and "Brand B" with proper spacing

3. **Comparison Results Display**
   - [ ] Empty state initially: "Select two brands and click Compare to see insights"
   - [ ] Loading state: Spinner + "Analyzing data... This may take 4-5 minutes"
   - [ ] Results state: Display analysis with title, cached badge (if applicable)
   - [ ] Title format: "Brand A vs Brand B" or "Brand A vs All Competitors" if brandB is null
   - [ ] Cached badge: "Cached Result" with success/10 background color
   - [ ] Results displayed in prose formatting (prose max-w-none)

4. **Recent Analyses List**
   - [ ] Section title: "Recent Analyses"
   - [ ] Show most recent 3 analyses initially
   - [ ] Format: "Brand A vs Brand B" with timestamp (e.g., "2h ago")
   - [ ] "View" link for each analysis (navigate to /dashboard/analysis/[id])
   - [ ] "Show more (X)" expandable link if more than 3 exist
   - [ ] Empty state: "No recent comparisons" if none exist
   - [ ] Fetch from database: ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10

5. **Compare Brands Button**
   - [ ] Disabled state when brands invalid (same or empty)
   - [ ] Loading state: Loader2 spinning icon + "Analyzing..."
   - [ ] Active state: "Compare Brands" text
   - [ ] Calls POST /api/analyze with { brandA, brandB } body
   - [ ] Handles success: displays results immediately
   - [ ] Handles error: shows error message in results panel with retry option

6. **Dedicated Analysis Detail Page**
   - [ ] Create new route: `src/app/dashboard/analysis/[id]/page.tsx`
   - [ ] Server Component fetching analysis by ID
   - [ ] Display full analysis title, timestamp, cached indicator
   - [ ] Show complete insights (all sections expanded)
   - [ ] Breadcrumbs: Dashboard > Analysis > [Date]
   - [ ] Action buttons: "← Back to Dashboard" and "Run New Comparison"
   - [ ] Print-friendly layout
   - [ ] 404 handling if analysis ID not found

7. **Loading & Error States**
   - [ ] Show Loader2 spinner when analysis is running
   - [ ] Display estimated time: "4-5 minutes for fresh analysis"
   - [ ] Error message with retry button if API call fails
   - [ ] Toast notification on analysis start/completion

### Integration Requirements

8. **API Integration**
   - [ ] POST /api/analyze endpoint unchanged
   - [ ] Request body: { brandA: string, brandB?: string }
   - [ ] Response includes: { id, brandA, brandB, insights, createdAt, isCached }
   - [ ] Handle both cached (<24hrs) and fresh analysis responses
   - [ ] Background job continues if user navigates away

9. **Database Integration**
   - [ ] Query recent analyses: SELECT * FROM analyses ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10
   - [ ] Query single analysis by ID: SELECT * FROM analyses WHERE id = $1
   - [ ] Join with plans table if needed for context

10. **Navigation Integration**
    - [ ] Breadcrumbs show: Dashboard > Brand Comparison
    - [ ] Header navigation remains visible and functional
    - [ ] Analysis detail page breadcrumbs: Dashboard > Analysis > [Date]

### Quality Requirements

11. **Responsive Design**
    - [ ] Desktop (1024px+): Split panel 30/70
    - [ ] Tablet (768px+): Stacked single column
    - [ ] Mobile fallback (<768px): Show "Desktop Required" message
    - [ ] No horizontal scroll on any supported viewport

12. **Performance**
    - [ ] Page loads immediately (Client Component)
    - [ ] Recent analyses fetched on mount (useEffect)
    - [ ] Analysis results update state without page reload
    - [ ] Sticky left panel doesn't cause scroll jank

13. **User Experience**
    - [ ] Clear visual feedback for all button states
    - [ ] Cache indicator clearly visible on results
    - [ ] Long analysis text scrolls in right panel only
    - [ ] Recent analyses list is scannable and compact

14. **Testing**
    - [ ] Test brand selection and validation logic
    - [ ] Test comparison with cached result (<24hrs)
    - [ ] Test comparison with fresh analysis (>24hrs or new brands)
    - [ ] Test error handling (API failure, network error)
    - [ ] Test navigation to analysis detail page
    - [ ] Test recent analyses list with 0, 3, 10+ items
    - [ ] Verify responsive layout on desktop and tablet

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure

```
ComparisonPage (Client Component)
├── DashboardHeader
├── Breadcrumbs
└── Grid Layout (lg:grid-cols-3)
    ├── Left Panel (lg:col-span-1, sticky)
    │   ├── Brand Selector (Select A)
    │   ├── Separator (↕)
    │   ├── Brand Selector (Select B)
    │   ├── Compare Button
    │   └── Recent Analyses List
    └── Right Panel (lg:col-span-2, scrollable)
        ├── Empty State
        ├── Loading State (Loader2)
        └── Results Display (Card with prose)
```

### State Management

```typescript
const [brandA, setBrandA] = useState<string>('')
const [brandB, setBrandB] = useState<string>('')
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
const [results, setResults] = useState<AnalysisResult | null>(null)
const [recentAnalyses, setRecentAnalyses] = useState<Analysis[]>([])
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)

const isValid = brandA && brandB && brandA !== brandB
```

### API Call Pattern

```typescript
const handleCompare = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true)
  setError(null)

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ brandA, brandB }),
    })

    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Analysis failed')

    const data = await response.json()
    setResults(data)
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message)
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}
```

### Required shadcn/ui Components

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add select
```
